# This is my first Python Program, starting of with printing 

#print("I like pizza!")
#print("It's really good!")

#Variables (str, int, float, bool) - variable behaves as if it was the value it contains

#strings
first_name = "Veljko"
food = "Pizza"
email = "veljko146@gmail.com"
print(f"Hello {first_name}")
print(f"You like {food}")
print(f"Your email is: {email   }")

#Integers
age = 24
quantity = 3
num_of_students = 30

print(f"You are {age} years old")
print(f"You are buying {quantity} items")
print(f"Your class {num_of_students} students")

#Float
price = 10.99
gpa = 3.2
distance = 5.5

print(f"The price is ${price}")
print(f"Your gpa is {gpa}")


#Booleans
is_student = False
if is_student:
    print("You are not a student")
else:
    print("You are a student")
